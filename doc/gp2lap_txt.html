<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
<p>This software is provided as is without warranty of any kind, either
expressed or implied. The authors will not be held responsible for any
losses incurred, either directly or indirectly, by the use of this program.

<p>This is not a Microprose product.


<h2>What is GP2Lap</h2>
<p>GP2Lap is a real-time extension for GP2. Its main functions include
logging information for online competitions, like processor occupancy,
and showing on-screen information such as the current standings,
fastest lap times, and a track map. Future versions of GP2Lap will
contain additional features; just check the GP2Lap home page regurarly
for updates.

<p>GP2Lap should work with all (language) versions of GP2. If you have
trouble getting it to work with your version then please let us know.

<p>Please read this file completely before contacting us.

<p>See the bottom of this file for our contact address and home page.


<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Extract <tt>gp2lap.zip</tt> and <tt>dos4gw.zip</tt> to your GP2 directory.
<table>The zips contain the following files:
<tr><td><tt>gp2lap.exe</tt> <td>The main executable.
<tr><td><tt>gp2lap.pif</tt> <td>Shortcut to gp2lap.
<tr><td><tt>gp2lap.txt</tt> <td>This HTML file as plain text.
<tr><td><tt>gp2lap.cfg</tt> <td>Standard configuration file.
<tr><td><tt>dos4gw.exe</tt> <td>DOS-extender by Rational Systems, Inc.
<tr><td><tt>faq.txt</tt> <td>Frequently asked questions
</table>
<p>Minimum system requirements are the same as for GP2, but 16MB memory
is recommended. It has been reported that GP2Lap or GP2 can give
<tt>out of memory</tt> errors with only 8MB memory.

<h2>Running GP2Lap</h2>
<p>GP2Lap is a 32-bit DOS program, just like GP2. It needs to load the
<tt>dos4gw.exe</tt> dos-extender, which should be located within your PATH
or in the same directory as GP2Lap. GP2Lap is supposed to be in the
same directory as <tt>gp2.exe</tt> is located, but it's only necessary that
the current directory is the GP2 directory for GP2Lap to run.


<h3>Starting</h3>
<p>To start, just enter the gp2lap executable name at the dos prompt:
<blockquote>
<tt>gp2lap.exe</tt>
</blockquote>

Under Windows, you can also start GP2Lap with:
<blockquote>
<tt>start gp2lap.pif</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>After GP2Lap is started it will try to find <tt>gp2.exe</tt> within the
current directory. If it's found, the game is automatically started.
Any command-line options you want to give GP2 should be passed to
GP2lap, which will pass them to GP2.

<p>If GP2 is started correctly, the GP2Lap logo should appear at the
right top of GP2's menu screen. If it's not there then something went
wrong and GP2Lap probably isn't activated.


<h3>Configuring</h3>
At startup, GP2Lap tries to read a configuration file called
<tt>gp2lap.cfg</tt>. This file contains options to configure GP2Lap to your
liking. You can specify a different config file with the <tt>cfg:</tt> command
line option. For example:

<blockquote>
<tt>gp2lap cfg:hof25.cfg</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>The configuration options will be explained thoughout this document.


<h3>Key bindings</h3>
GP2Lap uses so called pages to display some information at the top of the
screen. The current key mappings for these pages are:

<table>
<tr><td><kbd>1</kbd><td><a href="car_info">Car info</a>.
<tr><td><kbd>2</kbd><td><a href="debug_info">Debug log output</a>.
<tr><td><kbd>8</kbd><td><a href="track_map">Track map</a>.
<tr><td><kbd>9</kbd><td><a href="at_the_line">At The Line</a>.
<tr><td><kbd>0</kbd><td>Turn off any active page.
</table>

Each page could be optionally configured by pressing the same key again,
or by pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>`</kbd> (key above <kbd>TAB</kbd>).
Multiple pages can be activated at the same time by pressing <kbd>ctrl+pagenum</kbd>.
The last activated page will receive keyboard input.

<p>See the chapters about each specific page for more information.


<h3>Misc stuff</h3>
<ul>

<li>Pressing <kbd>f</kbd> during a replay (either normal or hotlap) will
toggle fast-forward mode. This will only work if your PO is much lower
than 100%, because no frames are being skipped. Instead, when a frame is
finished and fast-forward is active, GP2 will immediately start with the
next frame. For example, if your PO is 50%, fast-forward will make the
game run twice as fast.

<li>Some GP2Lap menu messages appear in the same language as your
<tt>gp2.exe</tt> version (never mind the translation mistakes :). If you want
them to always be in English, use the following line in the <tt>.cfg</tt> file:
<blockquote>
<tt>UseLocalizedStrings = 0</tt>
</blockquote>

<li>Custom track names in menu's. Enable this with the config option:
<blockquote>
<tt>CatchTrackNames = 1</tt>
</blockquote>
The track names will be extracted from the GP2INFO section of the
<tt>f1ctxx.dat</tt> file. Default tracks can have custom names too. Just add
it manually to the <tt>.dat</tt> file with a hex editor (don't forget to fix
the checksum), or use Paul Hoad's Track Editor. For example:
<blockquote>
<tt>#GP2INFO|Name|Imola Track|Country|San Marino|#</tt>
</blockquote>

<li>Custom split time sections. Enable this with the config option:
<blockquote>
<tt>CatchSplitSegs = 1</tt>
</blockquote>
The split time sections will be extracted from the GP2INFO section of
the <tt>f1ctxx.dat</tt> file too. They are meant to be put in there by the
creator of the track. It can be done manually, but Track Editor 1.79 or
newer supports it (older versions will crash when a track with custom splits
is loaded).
The splits have an own tag in the GP2INFO section, named Split1 and Split2.
The numbers can be decimal, hexadecimal (as shown below), or octal (with
leading zeros), and should be identical to the segment number shown in
the Track Editor. For example:
<blockquote>
<tt>#GP2INFO|Name|Imola Track|Country|San Marino|Split1|0x0200|Split2|0x0300|#</tt>
</blockquote>
With the Track Editor, e.g. just enter 0x0200 and 0x0300 into the Split1
and Split2 fields in the Track Name dialog.

<li>Option Spa98 will try to simulate the start of the Belgium '98 GP.

<li>Cockpit zooming. This is the same as the zoom setting in chase view,
which can be changed with keys <kbd>6</kbd> and <kbd>7</kbd>. For the cockpit this setting
has to be set in the gp2lap.cfg file like this:
<blockquote>
<tt>CockpitZoom = 256</tt>
</blockquote>
A value of 256 is the default setting of GP2. Smaller means zooming out,
which results in more sense of speed, but also in 'stretched' cars. It's
similar to the fov (field of vision) setting in Quake.

<li>Screenshot dump. No need to run pcxdump anymore. To create a screenshot
simply press F12. This will save a screenshot to file <tt>gp2_xxxx.bmp</tt>.

<li>Pressing <kbd>F8</kbd> will pause like <kbd>p</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd>,
but without a "paused" message.

<li> Screen output height. Specify the height in pixels with:
<blockquote>
<tt>DrawLines = 194</tt>
</blockquote>
This value is in pixels and has a maximum of 479.

<li>Rcr values. Vincent van Vugt says: The lower the amount, the sooner it
  will use the rcr-jam. If the amount is 0 it will only use rcr-jams (which is
  *really* ugly by the way). Rcr-jams use less cpu-power so it's useful for
  people with older computers.
  Specify the values with the following options:
<dl>
<dt><tt>VgaRcr1 = 2128</tt>
<dt><tt>SvgaRcr1 = 3200</tt>
	<dd>How far away an rcr-jam will be used if you're looking from within the
		cockpit.
<dt><tt>VgaRcr2 = 2128</tt>
<dt><tt>SvgaRcr2 = 3200</tt>
	<dd>How far away an rcr-jam will be used if you're looking through an
		onboard camera. This is one used within Paul's car editor.
<dt><tt><tt>VgaRcr3 = 2640</tt>
<dt><tt>SvgaRcr3 = 4096</tt>
	<dd>How far away an rcr-jam will be used if you're looking through the on
		track camera's or if you're looking in front or rear of the car.
</ul>

<h2>Log System</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>While you're playing GP2, GP2Lap is just sitting around, doing nothing
but waiting for specific events to happen. These events include:
starting GP2, starting a session, loading a game, entering/leaving the
pit, crossing the finish line, etc.

<p>At all these specific events, the log system gets some information about
the event, which is then stored in memory buffers. When you save your
hotlap or game, most of the information is attached to the file being
saved. These are called <i>GP2Lap extended files</i>.

<p>As of version 1.07, it's possible to save this information to a
separate <tt>.GLx</tt> file. The following line in <tt>gp2lap.cfg</tt> will enable this:
<blockquote>
<tt>logGLX = 1</tt>
</blockquote>
The <tt>.GLx</tt> file will have the same name as the saved game/hotlap, and
will also contain driver names and car setups. They can be read by
HOF2Lap 0.55+ and F1LapView 1.02+.

<p>Additionally, this option will allow you to log computer cars by
enabling the following option:
<blockquote>
<tt>logCC = 1</tt>
</blockquote>
This option won't work for the GP2Lap extended files because the
amount of data will overflow GP2's own internal save buffer.


<h3>Hotlaps</h3>
<p>Extended hotlaps will contain general information and info for this
specific lap.

<p>General information includes all "physics" (of which some can be edited
with the so called Quick 'n' Dirty editor), car damage limit values,
pit speed limit, track information, computer car performance, and more.

<p>Lap information includes lap time, average and maximum processor
occupancy (to detect "slomo" driving), and more.

<p>Extended info can be extracted from the hotlap with HOF2Lap,
version 0.50 or later. Go to the
<a href="http://rsdi.home.xs4all.nl/hof2lap/">HOF2Lap home page</a>
to download it.


<h3>Saved games</h3>
<p>Extended save games will contain general information and lap information
for all laps. This information can be extracted by HOF2Lap too. When an
extended game is loaded, its logged data for each lap will be loaded too.


<h3>Authentication disclaimer</h3>
<p>If you're being disqualified do NOT contact us. Contact the competition
director(s). If the extended save game or hotlap seems to be corrupted
in some way causing the disqualification, the director will contact us,
and we will look into it. Remember that things like an edited track (no
matter how little the change) is logged by GP2Lap and might cause
your disqualification. Make sure you always use the correct car set
and tracks (the ones specified by the competition rules).

<p>Also remember that validating the saved games is done by the director,
a database script, and/or a verification team, not by GP2Lap or HOF2Lap.
GP2Lap just logs raw data, it doesn't interpret it.


<a name="debug_info"></a>
<h3>Debug info</h3>
<p>GP2Lap can dump some debug info about most events in a separate logfile
called <tt>gp2lap.log</tt>. This is readable text, so you can see what has
happened exactly, or you can send it to us in case you suspect there's
something wrong. It's of no other use, so you can as well ignore it.
It can be turned on by specifying this line in the configuration file:
<blockquote>
<tt>logDebug = 1</tt>
</blockquote>

The name of the logfile can be specified with:
<blockquote>
<tt>logDebugName = "gp2lap.log"</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: this is not the main log file of GP2Lap! It's just for debugging
purposes. The real log information is attached to save files.

<p>You can view this info in-game by pressing the <kbd>2</kbd> key
while you're in the cockpit.

<h3>Extension of perf files</h3>
Version 1.04 introduces extension of perf data. To enable it, add the
following to the <tt>gp2lap.cfg</tt> file:

<blockquote>
<tt>logPerf = 1</tt>
</blockquote>

GP2Lap will then add car position data and high-resolution wheel speed
data to the perf files you save.
It will also save a special data file with track data in directory
<i>gp2lpdat</i> under the main GP2 directory, which is used by
F1PerfView to draw a track.

<p><b>Warning</b>: with longer laps (about 1m40 and longer, or bigger than 75KB),
the internal GP2 perf viewer will complain about the size when you load the perf file.
If you're using the internal viewer and not F1PerfView, disable the <tt>logPerf</tt> option
to prevent this error.



<a name="at_the_line"></a>
<h2>At The Line</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>GP2Lap provides some additional timing information to improve gameplay.
Have you ever wondered about your inpit/outpit laptimes? Now you'll
get them. Are you tired of waiting for the next straight to take a quick
look at other cars' laptimes? You'll get them too and much more...

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Just hit <kbd>9</kbd> while sitting in the car to turn it on.
Within "At the line", display can be changed using the following keys:

<p><table>
<tr><td><kbd>9</kbd> <td>turn on / change the size of the board
<tr><td><kbd>~</kbd> <td>scroll through positions (note: this is the key
above the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key and left of the <kbd>1</kbd> key)
<tr><td><kbd>TAB</kbd> <td>switch between different tables
<tr><td><kbd>0</kbd> <td>turn off
</table>

<p>Currently, the following tables are available:

<p><table>(1)
<tr><td><b>Pos</b> <td><b>Driver</b> <td><b>behind</b>
<tr><td>01. <td>Hill <td>1:43:47.407
<tr><td>02. <td>R Schumacher <td>+0.932
<tr><td>03. <td>Alesi <td>+7.240
<tr><td>04. <td>Frentzen <td>+32.242
<tr><td>05. <td>Diniz <td>+51.682
</table>
Shows the gaps between the cars.

<p><table>(2)
<tr><td><b>Pos</b> <td><b>Driver</b> <td><b>laptime</b> <td>
<tr><td>01. <td>Hill <td>1:47.407 <td><- 3
<tr><td>02. <td>R Schumacher <td>1:49.932 <td>
<tr><td>03. <td>Alesi <td>1:47.240 <td><- 2
<tr><td>04. <td>Frentzen <td>1:32.242 <td><- 1
<tr><td>05. <td>Diniz <td>1:51.682 <td>
</table>
Shows the actual lap times of all cars. The three fastest laps will be marked.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>These tables will be updated in real-time, but may contain some
glitches, especially after a replay or loading a game.
<li>These tables only work in race sessions. In non-race sessions they
are replaced by two other tables that show sector times and the
ideal lap time. The sector times can be compared with any other
driver.
<li>Displaying these tables can add upto about 10% to
your processor occupancy, depending on your system configuration.
</ul>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
The following configuration options are available:

<dl>
<dt><tt>atlNoFastestLap</tt>
	<dd>Don't show "Fastest Lap by...." if active.
<dt><tt>atlSplit1Color</tt>
	<dd>Taken from gp2's color palette, default: 135 (lblue).
<dt><tt>atlSplit2Color</tt>
	<dd>Default: 125 (blue).
<dt><tt>atlLineColor</tt>
	<dd>Default: 151 (dblue).
<dt><tt>atlAcrossTop</tt>
	<dd>Show info across the top of the screen.
<dt><tt>atlMarkTopX</tt>
	<dd>How many cars to mark on the laptime board, range is 3..9.
</dl>


<a name="track_map"></a>
<h2>Track Map</h2>
This feature will show a top view of the track, which will give
you the opportunity to know what's going on elsewhere on the
track.

<p>For example, during qualify it will be easier to determine
when the track is clear (or not, if you want slipstreams), so you
can start your flying lap at the right moment. It also helps to
know when you can rejoin the track without crashing into other
cars after you went off.

<p>The map will show a black track, a gray pit lane, split section
borders and all the cars on it as little dots (or off it if they
went off-track).

<h3>Usage</h3>
The track map can be enabled by pressing '8'. Press '8' again
to change the alignment (left, middle, right). If it's on the
left or right, it will also be clipped so it won't distract
too much from your race.

<p>While the track map is enabled, press the <kbd>TAB</kbd>
key to change the zoom level.
There are six zoom levels. The smallest one
will show you the whole track, and it won't move. The other zoom
levels will center the selected car's position, so the track will scroll while
you're driving. It will also rotate according to the selected
car's speed angle. This can be toggled with <kbd>m</kbd>.

<p>You can press <kbd>0</kbd> (or a different page) to disable the track
map.

Press <kbd>~</kbd> (above <kbd>TAB</kbd>) to change the track color.


<h3>Car Colours</h3>
The player cars are blinking red. If the pit light is enabled,
they will be blinking yellow.

<p>The computer cars are white. If they go to the pit, they will
be yellow. If you select a computer car (up/down arrows), that
car will be blinking green, even if it's going to pit.

<p>If a car has retired, it will be dark red. It stays in view,
even if it has been removed from the track (it's lying there
behind the wall).


<h3>Notes</h3>
The track width may not seem correct sometimes. This is because
it isn't calculated, but the pixels are just made bigger according
to the zoom level.


<h3>Configuration</h3>
The configuration options provided for the track map are:
<dl>
<dt><tt>mapZoom</tt>
	<dd>Zoom level, range 0..5, 0 shows the whole track.
<dt><tt>mapTrackColor</tt>
	<dd>Initial color of the track to start with.
<dt><tt>mapHAlign</tt>
	<dd>Initial horizontal alignment.
	0 = left, 1 = center, 2 = right.
<dt><tt>mapVAlign</tt>
	<dd>Initial vertical alignment. It's relative to mapMaxY.
	0 = top, 1 = center, 3 = bottom. 
<dt><tt>mapRotate</tt>
	<dd>Initial rotation setting (1 is enabled).
<dt><tt>mapMaxY</tt>
	<dd>Y clipping. Maximum is the DrawLines setting. Note that the
	outside view is 400 pixels high.
	VGA will use half the value specified here.
<dt><tt>mapDotSize</tt>
	<dd>Dot sizes of cars at each of 6 zoom levels. Default 122358,
	min. 111111, max. 999999.
<dt><tt>mapDotSizeVGA</tt>
	<dd>Same as mapDotSize, but for VGA. Default 111235.
</dl>


<a name="car_info"></a>
<h2>Car Info</h2>
This shows you information about the selected car. It is to provide
this info for those that like to drive using the external view.
Currently shows the gear, revs, and speed.
<p>It is on a separate page, and can be activated by pressing <kbd>1</kbd>.
Pressing <kbd>1</kbd> again toggles the alignment from left to right.


<a name="trackman"></a>
<h2>Track Manager</h2>
From version 1.13 onwards it's possible to tell GP2Lap which track
files should be used. These can be specified in the <tt>.cfg</tt> file. The
following options are available:

<dl>
<dt><tt>f1ct01</tt>
	<dd>Path of track file. E.g. "<i>circuits\brazil99.dat</i>".
<dt><tt>f1ct02</tt>
<dt><tt>...</tt>
<dt><tt>f1ct16</tt>
</dl>

The specified paths have to be relative to the GP2 directory and
must be in DOS file name format.

<p>Further options:
<dl>
<dt><tt>CatchTrackInfos</tt>
	<dd>Try catching GP2INFO's from custom track files. This info
	will be shown at the bottom of the track menu. More
	importantly, this will patch hardcoded tables within GP2 that
	will fix distances, average speed, multiplayer turns, etc.
<dt><tt>CatchSplitSegs</tt>
	<dd>Try catching new splits from custom track files.
<dt><tt>MenuTrackMap</tt>
	<dd>Draw a simple track map layout in the track selection menu.
	This replaces the usual bitmap. Default 0 (off).
</dl>


<h2>IpxLinking</h2>
<p>Since version 1.01 GP2Lap contains ipx network support for GP2's
dual-player link mode.
<p>A few notes:
<ul>
<li>You can only play head to head with another person.
<li>It's exactly like a normal serial linking, but using Ipx interface
instead of a null-modem cable.
<li>Don't expect performance wonders, although one person claimed it's
being slightly faster than serial link.
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<ol>
<li>In preparation to starting a link, specify the following in <tt>gp2lap.cfg</tt>:
<blockquote>
<tt>UseIPXLink = 1
    MyLinkName = "YourName Here"
</tt>
</blockquote>
<li>After starting <tt>gp2lap.exe</tt> you'll see:
<blockquote>
<tt>>>>Searching players [-]</tt>
</blockquote>
<li>Once GP2Lap found some players, it will change f.i. to:
<blockquote>
<tt>>>>Found 2 players. Choose player -["Paul Tracy" (00001B30BC57)]</tt>
</blockquote>
<li>Select the player you wanna race against, using <kbd>UP</kbd>/<kbd>DOWN</kbd> or <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key.
Next, you'll see this:
<blockquote>
<tt>>>>Awaiting reply from "Paul Tracy" [/]</tt>
</blockquote>
<li>You'll get notice whether the person wants to play with you or not.
</ol>

<h3>Tech Stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently using ipx socket 0x5100 only.
<li>The handshake is quite clumsy, but please don't complain.
<li>We did some successfull tests under DOS and(!) Win95.
</ul>

<h2>HOF2.5</h2>
Version 1.03 introduces HOF2.5 mode. Since version 1.12 it will work
in all non-race sessions.
You can enable it with the following line in the <tt>.cfg</tt> file:

<blockquote>
<tt>hof25Enable = 1</tt>
</blockquote>

The GP2Lap archive includes an example configuration file for HOF2.5,
and a batch file (<tt>hof25.bat</tt>) to start GP2Lap with this .cfg file.

<p>During this mode, GP2Lap will do some extra checks for hotlapping,
specifically for hotlaps that will be entered in the Hall Of Fame 2.5,
although it will be of use for other leagues too.
So make sure you only activate it when it's required for the
league you're competing in.


<h3>Extra checks</h3>
The following things are currently being checked:
<ul>
<li><b>Tracks must be HOF2.5 compliant</b>. All default tracks, and all
custom tracks being downloaded from the HOF2.5 home page are
HOF2.5 compliant. GP2Lap will check a track file after it's
being loaded. Tracks must also be placed into the correct slot.
<li><b>Cutting chicanes</b>. At some chicanes GP2Lap checks if they're
being cut off. If that is the case, you will lose each wheel
that is not on the track.
<li><b>Load from saved game</b>. If you load your unlimited
practice session from a saved game, this game must have been
saved while GP2Lap was active, and in HOF2.5 mode.
<li><b>Slowdown before start of lap</b>. When you load your game to the
end of the warmup lap, you must have saved it before the last
corner. To mandate this, GP2Lap checks if you've slowed down
between the load and the start of the lap for at least about
half a second. If you haven't slowed down, the <kbd>2</kbd> output will
appear with a warning that this lap will be disqualified.
<li><b>Detail changes</b>. To prevent influencing the processor occupancy
during a lap, GP2Lap checks any detail level changes (alt-d).
If it's detected, the lap is disqualified.
<li><b>Indestructability changes</b>. In HOF2.5, usage of F4 is not allowed.
If GP2Lap detects that it has been used during a lap, the lap will be
disqualified.
</ul>

<p>For some of these checks menu messages may
appear while loading a track or while saving the hotlap, informing
you of the disqualification. In some of these cases (last four of
the above checks), the saved hotlap will not contain GP2Lap
extended information at all.
